## Deadline

For Form 1120S, which is used by S corporations to file their U.S. Income Tax Return, the initial filing deadline is March 15th, 2024, for the tax year 2023.

If an extension is filed using Form 7004, an automatic 6-month extension is granted, pushing the extended deadline to September 16th, 2024 (as September 15th falls on a Sunday in 2024).

So, the extended deadline for filing Form 1120S for the 2023 tax year is September 16th, 2024.
